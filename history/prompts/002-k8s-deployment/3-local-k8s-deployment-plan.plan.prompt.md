# Local Kubernetes Deployment Plan

## Description
Created the implementation plan for Phase IV: Local Kubernetes Deployment for The Evolution of Todo. This plan transforms the approved specification into a production-hardened, demo-dominating local Kubernetes deployment on Minikube using pure agentic workflow with Gordon (Docker AI), kubectl-ai, kagent, and Helm charts.

## Prompt
```
/sp.plan Local Kubernetes Deployment for The Evolution of Todo - Phase IV: Cloud-Native Todo Chatbot
Create: A ruthless, elite-grade, zero-compromise execution blueprint that transforms the approved v1_k8s_deployment.spec.md into a production-hardened, demo-dominating local Kubernetes deployment on Minikube — using pure agentic workflow, Gordon (Docker AI), kubectl-ai, kagent, Helm charts, and the full squad of Phase IV agents & skills. This plan must force every agent (Docker Engineer → Helm Chart Engineer → Kubernetes Deploy Agent → AIOps Troubleshooter → K8s Validation Agent) to deliver flawless, enterprise-level infrastructure that makes hackathon judges say: “This isn’t a student project — this is real cloud-native mastery running on a laptop.”
Decisions needing documentation:
Docker Strategy: Gordon-first intelligence vs. standard best-practice fallback (Gordon priority — if unavailable/region-locked, fallback to ultra-optimized multi-stage Dockerfiles generated by Docker Engineer Agent)
Helm Chart Generation: kubectl-ai first-generation vs. kagent refinement (kubectl-ai for initial chart + values, kagent for resource tuning, probe hardening & optimization)
Minikube Driver & Resources: docker driver with --cpus=4 --memory=8192 vs. default (always force higher resources for realistic chatbot performance)
Ingress vs. Port-Forward: Enable ingress addon + minikube tunnel vs. simple port-forward (ingress enabled for production-lns, kubectl-ai/kagent outputs, troubleshooting wins
Demo assets: screenshots, logs, short script “Watch me deploy, break, heal with AI”
README updated with full copy-paste deploy sequence
Timeline: Complete entire cloud-native deployment within 24–48 hours via parallel agent execution
Prioritize: Phase 1–4 (foundation & images/charts) in first 12 hours, then hardening & demo polish
Guiding mantra:
This is not deployment — this is a declaration of dominance over mediocre infrastructure.
Every AI tool is a weapon.
Deliver a local Kubernetes setup so clean, intelligent, resilient, and professional that judges forget it’s running on a laptop.
Tabahi. Mastery. No prisoners.
```

## Response
Created comprehensive implementation plan with:

- Technical Context: Defined Dockerfile/YAML/Helm templates, dependencies (Docker, Minikube, Helm, kubectl-ai, kagent), target platform (Minikube with Docker driver), performance goals (--cpus=4 --memory=8192), and constraints (zero manual coding)
- Constitution Check: Verified all constitutional principles passed (AI-First DevOps, Production Hardening, Security-First, etc.)
- Project Structure: Defined directory structure with docker/, charts/, k8s/, and specs/deployment/ directories
- Research Document: Documented key technical decisions (Gordon-first Docker strategy, kubectl-ai+kagent Helm generation, Minikube configuration)
- Data Model: Created Kubernetes resource models for deployments, services, ingress, secrets, HPAs, and network policies
- Quickstart Guide: Provided comprehensive setup instructions with minikube, docker, helm, and ai-tool usage
- API Contracts: Created OpenAPI specification for the backend service endpoints
